    fixed point is a simple yet very powerful way to represent fractional numbers in computer.
    By reusing all integer arithmetic circuits of a computer, fixed point arithmetic is orders
    of magnitude faster than floating point arithmetic. This is the reason why it is being used
    in many game and DSP applications. On the other hand, it lacks the range and precision that
    floating point number representation offers. You, as a programmer or circuit designer, must do the tradeoff.
